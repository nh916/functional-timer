# functional-timer

This is the first package I have made. Please report any bugs. 

I made this for my own project and saw that I could not find something easy to use on npm that would handle a simple implementation of a JavScript timer for me, so I wrote one with vanilla JavaScript functions. I figured a timer is a simple code that can often be used in projects, and no need to rewrite it every time.

The code can be refactored to be improved and more efficient, I just have not had the chance to do that. If I get a chance I will be adding more comments and more documentation to make it very simple to understand. 

Feel free to contribute to it, and make it better. Looking forward to seeing others using it and contributing to it!
